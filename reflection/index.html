        <p>Thus far, I think that my portfolio is coming along well, and I am happy with my current page layouts,
            animations and ease of navigation. I might switch the color scheme later because its not my favorite, but I
            will have to do more research about it. Fonts are easy to read and there is good contrast on the website.
            Through the process of creating my digital portfolio, I have learned more about digital design, coding in
            HTML and websites in general.

            Currently I don’t have any questions, but some might arise in the future. Since I’m kind of new to HTML and
            CSS, my web design skills are not perfect, so I find it a little difficult, but I am still making progress
            every day. I think that multiple web design sources might assist me In the future to be able to add my
            projects to the portfolio, with a good design and a sense of cool, and calm colors.
